## Features
1. This application provides our strong and dependable burger paradise managers with easy-to-use reservation management tools to create reservations, track reservations, seat tables and modify them. 

2. Create (New Reservations): On the left toolbar, where all of the main functions are present, our managers will be able to quickly select "New Reservation" and this will immediately load them into the create reservation form, with validation measures to ensure high-standards of data control.

3. Edit: We know that in this industry, things change, whether a customer needs to adjust their information, or a manager notices a mistake in the original creation, they are able to edit the information on the reservation as needed.

4. Cancellation: Sadly, sometimes we need to cancel placed reservations and remove them from the system. Managers and authorized employees are now able to cancel an existing reservation. There is an added step to confirm, or cancel, the cancellation, just to be safe.

5. Seating/Assigning: Clicking the "seat" option on an existing reservation will allow staff to be able to assign tables to the reservation when it's time.

Furthermore, when a table is finished with their meal, you will be able to select "finish" to clear the table and open availability for more valuable customers.

6. Create (New Tables): Different tables may or may not be used or available on given days, you are also able to create new tables to be available for reservations!

Additional Feature: Searching Reservations by Phone: Managers can also search for reservations by phone-number, this will expedite the process for locating orders when there are heavier workloads.

## Future Expansions
1. Manager Access / Employee Access: There may be functions and tools that only managers would need, or prefer to have access to. I can strengthen integrity, and usability by having employee and manageral access separate. This could be a simple toggle, this could be needing a PIN to access manager-only tools, and so on!

2. Search by: I want to expand the search tool to allow for searching on any of the form elements, such as name, date (in future ranges), and more, this will continue to ease the use for managers and employees alike.
